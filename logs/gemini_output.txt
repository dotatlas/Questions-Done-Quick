  "explanation": "RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. By taking the square root, the metric is returned to the original units of the target variable, making it easier to interpret.",
  "verification": "MSE is in squared units (e.g., if the target is dollars, MSE is in dollars squared). R-squared (R²) is a dimensionless ratio between 0 and 1. RSE, if it refers to Relative Squared Error, is also a dimensionless ratio; if it refers to Residual Standard Error, while it is in original units, RMSE is the more commonly cited example for this property in introductory contexts.",
